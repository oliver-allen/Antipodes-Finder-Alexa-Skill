## Antipodes Finder
Antipodes Finder is a certified and published Alexa skill allows you to find the antipode of any location. The antipodes is the location on the other side of the world. It is the location where you would end up if you tunnelled through the centre of the Earth. Since the Earth is mostly covered by water, the antipodes of many cities is water. However, there are locations that have an antipodes on land.
